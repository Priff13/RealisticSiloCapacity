# RealisticSiloCapacity
Implements realistic silo capacity, silos will now be able to hold up to 330,000 hay.
## What makes this "realistic"?
According to the Alamaba Cooperative Extension System, "A laying hen will consume between 100 and 150 grams of feed per day or roughly 0.25 pounds." [Source](https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farming/backyard-small-poultry-flock-management-series-feeding-the-laying-hen/).
According to the Oregon State University Forage Information System, "Storage silos are cylindrical structures, typically 10 to 90 ft (3 to 27 m) in diameter and 30 to 275 ft (10 to 90 m) in height." [Source](https://forages.oregonstate.edu/oregon/topics/storage/silos#:~:text=Storage%20silos%20are%20cylindrical%20structures,%20(10%20to%2090%20m)%20in%20height.)
Assuming the size of the silo in Stardew Valley to be smaller than the average, I estimate the size of the Stardew Valley silo to be 17.2 ft wide in diameter, and 43.1 ft tall.  
Using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, I calculated that the volume of the Stardew Valley silo is ~10014.38ft<sup>3</sup>.
According to the University of Georgia, the density of Hay is ~10lbs/ft<sup>3</sup>.
Putting this all together, I calculated the supposed capacity of the Stardew Valley silo to be ~300,000 hay, which I altered to 330,000.
